# Wardriving
Objective: Inform the Amherst community about the dangers of using outdated Wi-Fi encrpytion techniques.

# What is Wardriving?
Wardriving is the act of searching for and often mapping wireless network access points with a mobile device while driving in a vehicle. These access points are what your wireless device connects to when seeking to gain access to the internet and your network.  Once connected, you device will send information to this access point over Wi-Fi signals.  Unfortunatly anyone who desires can easily observe this traffic without any special equipment or having access to your network.  This means that anyone could reconstruct your network traffic and view all the information you are sending over Wi-Fi if your traffic is not properly encrypted.  Malicious wardrivers take advantage of this by scouting out and mapping entire neighborhoods looking for vulnerable networks to prey on.  Once they have aa selection of networks they can access them and perform actions such as stealing personal and private information or distribnuting child pronography.

This wardriving project and my personal intentions varied greatly from those that are held by malicious wardrivers.  Rather than mapping networks for future criminal activity, I gathered data to see how many home and small bussiness wireless networks were not using encryption or still using WEP (Wireless Equivilent Privacy - An encryption method that is outdated and ineffective).  I also refused to connect to anyones private wireless network because connecting to non-public networks without permission is illegal.
